## Valory Brand Guidelines 

The "Olas" & "Autonolas" names, logos, brands, and other trademarks, are property of Olas DAO (aka Autonolas DAO^), considered Offerings subject to [our Terms](https://olas.network/disclaimer), meaning you may use them only as described therein. *apart from Valory owning Olas name I'll put something here and take language from our terms*

These guidelines are intended to help people interacting with the Olas brand to understand how to use and display our trademarks and copyrighted work in their own assets and materials.

^Autonolas is now known as Olas, for short.

## Examples
Do:
* Use the Olas logo in articles, blog posts or other media mentions of Olas
* Use our logo to link to olas.network
* Publicly claiming only relationships to the Olas DAO itself that are reflected in an on/off-chain vote, expressed as they are expressed therein ^to add link here.Request DAO contributors' written approval to publicly mention an existing relationship between you and them, e.g. a partnership, sponsorship, or grant program. 
* Use the specific language used in writing by the DAO in an on/off-chain vote and by DAO contributors regarding the relationship, e.g. 'we have received a grant from Valory, co-creators of Olas' or 'we are sponsoring an event with [name here], an Olas founding member'.

Do not:
* Use the Olas logo (or part of our logo) in a way that implies the Olas DAO‚Äôs endorsement or sponsorship of a project, service, product or individual
* Misrepresent, embellish, or invent a relationship between the Olas DAO or any of its contributors and you (for example by implying a partnership where there exists only a grant, or referring to non-finalized agreements). The Olas DAO and its contributors likely have official partnerships and specific language about these partnerships, as well as non-partnership language guidance. If you are not an official partner, please don‚Äôt use ‚Äúcollaborated with,‚Äù ‚Äúworked with,‚Äù or ‚Äúpartnered with,‚Äù in any form. (See above for accurate language.)

## Information about Olas & Press Releases 
When mentioning the Olas DAO or its members or contributors in your press materials, we kindly ask that you review the following information.

### Key information
#### Introduction
* Context: Olas is the network for generating & co-owning autonomous agent economies, based on cutting-edge decentralized autonomous agent technology. 
* Mission: Established in 2021, Olas' mission is to enable anyone to generate swarms of autonomous agents and grow them into entire economies, coordinated by the OLAS token.^ 
* Background: Olas consists of the composable [Olas Stack](https://olas.network/build) for developing on Olas and the [Olas Protocol](protocol.olas.network) incentivizing their creation and decentralized operation. Together this architecture works to grow code and capital in tandem via novel mechanisms including Bonding, Developer Rewards, Triple Lock, and Olas Staking's Proof of Active Agent (PoAA). Olas has already given rise to a growing ocean of services, including [Olas Predict](https://olas.network/services/prediction-agents), agents that are predicting the future and leading the charge of Olas agents [taking over Gnosis Chain and beyond](https://dune.com/adrian0x/autonolas-ecosystem-activity).^^^^ Since 'Olas' means 'waves' in Spanish, it is sometimes referred to as the 'ocean of services' üåä.
* Crypto x AI: Olas is perfect for combining crypto and AI, since autonomous services built using Olas can run complex logic in a decentralized manner, interacting with on- and off-chain data autonomously and continuously. For novel use cases check out [olas.network](https://olas.network/).
