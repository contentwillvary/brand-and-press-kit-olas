## Valory Brand Guidelines 
*(Logos are available via logos.zip file in this repo)*

The "Valory" name, the Valory logo, the "Olas" and “Propel” brands, and other Valory trademarks, are property of Valory AG (aka Valory), considered Offerings subject to [our Terms](https://valory.xyz/terms), meaning you may use them only as described therein. 

These guidelines are intended to help our partners, grant recipients, sponsors, customers, developers, consultants, publishers, and any other third parties understand how to use and display our trademarks and copyrighted work in their own assets and materials.

## Examples

* Use our logo to link to valory.xyz
* Request written approval to publicly mention an existing relationship between you and Valory, e.g. a partnership, sponsorship, or grant program.
* Use the specific language used in writing by us regarding the relationship, e.g. 'we have received a grant from Valory' or 'we are sponsoring Valory's event'.
