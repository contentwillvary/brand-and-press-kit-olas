# Olas Brand and Press Kit
This Olas Brand and Press Kit summarizes the Olas DAO's Brand Guidelines (inc. use of language and assets) and Information about Olas, also known as Autonolas (e.g. for Press Releases).

![Olas Brand](https://github.com/contentwillvary/brand-and-press-kit-olas/assets/106149667/8f65fd6d-f571-45f4-a843-2e6f1e75482c)


## Brand Guidelines 

The "Olas", "Autonolas" & "Pearl" names, logos, brands, and other trademarks, are property of Olas DAO (aka Autonolas DAO^) or its members, protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws and may only be used per the Usage Terms (see below). These guidelines are designed to align with the [Olas DAO Constitution](https://gateway.autonolas.tech/ipfs/bafybeibrhz6hnxsxcbv7dkzerq4chssotexb276pidzwclbytzj7m4t47u) and can be updated from time to time by the Olas DAO as required. 
These guidelines are intended to help people interacting with the Olas brand to understand how to use and display the Olas DAO's trademarks and copyrighted work in their own assets and materials.

^Autonolas is also known as Olas, for short.

## Language

Do:
* Link to [olas.network](https://olas.network) in articles, blog posts or other media mentions describing Olas' own work.
* Publicly claim only relationships to the Olas DAO itself that have been recorded in an [on-chain vote](https://boardroom.io/autonolas/overview) or [off-chain vote](https://snapshot.org/#/autonolas.eth), describing these relationships as they are expressed therein. Request DAO contributors' written approval prior to publicly mentioning an existing relationship between you and them, e.g. a partnership, sponsorship, or grant program. 
* Use the specific language used in writing by the DAO in an on/off-chain vote and by DAO contributors regarding the relationship, e.g. 'we have received a grant from Valory, co-creators of Olas' or 'we are sponsoring an event with [name here], an Olas founding member'.
* Those building on Olas must use descriptive phrases that make it clear your product is developed on Olas technology (“powered by” is preferred, but “built on” can also be used). Avoid phrases that imply an official partnership with Olas (“built with”, “developed with”, “partnered with”).
Your company or product name should appear first, followed by Olas and the autonomous service or component name. Using 'Olas' in product or app names is prohibited because it confuses end users, e.g. 'OlasBots', etc.

Do not:
* Use the Olas logo (or part of the Olas logo) alongside or without text in a way that implies the Olas DAO’s endorsement or sponsorship of a project, service, product or individual.
* Misrepresent, embellish, or invent a relationship between the Olas DAO or any of its contributors and you (for example by implying a partnership where there exists only a grant, or referring to non-finalized agreements). The Olas DAO and its contributors likely have official partnerships and specific language about these partnerships, as well as non-partnership language guidance. If you are not an official partner, please don’t use “collaborated with,” “worked with,” or “partnered with,” in any form. (See above for accurate language.)

## Information about Olas & Press Releases 
When mentioning the Olas DAO or its members or contributors in your press materials, it is kindly asked that you review the following information.

### Key information
#### One liner
The network/platform^^ for co-owning AI. Olas enables everyone to own a share of AI, specifically autonomous agents.

^^ 'Network' tends to be used for a web3 audience, and 'platform' for a web2 audience.

#### Boilerplate
* One of the first Crypto x AI projects, founded in 2021, Olas offers the composable [Olas Stack](https://olas.network/stack) for developing autonomous AI agents, and the [Olas Protocol](https://olas.network/protocol) for incentivizing their creation and co-ownership. Olas' mission is to incentivize and coordinate different parties to launch autonomous agents that form entire AI economies serving all humans. Olas is giving rise to agent economies across major blockchains. Check [the Olas website](https://olas.network/) to see how many hundreds of thousands of transactions have been made. In [Olas Predict](https://olas.network/services/prediction-agents), AI agents predict the future, using state-of-the-art AI models, then apply their predictions to on-chain markets. Learn more at [olas.network](https://olas.network). 

#### More on...
##### The Olas Protocol
* [Olas Protocol](https://olas.network/protocol) grows code and capital via novel mechanisms including [Bonding](https://olas.network/blog/code-capital-attracting-capital-via-bonding) and [Developer Rewards](https://olas.network/blog/code-capital-attracting-code-via-developer-rewards), and [Triple Lock](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-aip/blob/aip-1/content/aips/core-aip-triple-lock.md). Agent operators are incentivized via a unique blend of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake: [Olas Staking, using Proof of Active Agent (PoAA)](https://staking.olas.network/).
##### The Olas Stack
* [Olas Stack](https://olas.network/stack) is perfect for combining crypto and AI, autonomous services built using Olas can run decentralized, complex logic, off-chain whilst interacting with on- and off-chain data autonomously and continuously.
##### [The Olas ecosystem](https://olas.network)
* The Olas ecosystem boasts more than 1000+ agents, including collaborations with notable projects such as [Gnosis Chain, Celo, Solana, Balancer, Ceramic, DeFi Wonderland, and others](https://olas.network/#ecosystem). 
##### The name - Olas/Autonolas?
* At launch, the project was called 'Autonolas' which combined 'autonomy' and 'olas'. 'Olas' means 'waves' in Spanish. Now, the project often goes by the nickname 'Olas', becoming known as 'crypto's ocean of agents' 🌊.
##### The symbol ☴
* ☴ is a hexagram from the Yi Ching, the oldest known book. It represents wind and symbolically reinforces 'olas' which means waves in Spanish. Together, they create a sense of vibrancy as generated by Olas' autonomous agents, who generate waves of activity on top of the blockchain.
