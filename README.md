# press-kit-olas
This Press Kit summarizes the Olas DAO's Brand Guidelines (inc. logos) and Information about Olas (also known as Autonolas, e.g. for Press Releases)

![Olas Brand](https://github.com/contentwillvary/press-kit-olas/assets/106149667/317e54ea-5bc7-4e07-ad35-04c64e332314)

## Brand Guidelines 

The "Olas" & "Autonolas" names, logos, brands, and other trademarks, are property of Olas DAO (aka Autonolas DAO^), protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret
and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws and may only be used per the Usage Terms (see below). These guidelines are intended to help people interacting with the Olas brand to understand how to use and display the Olas DAO's trademarks and copyrighted work in their own assets and materials.

^Autonolas is also known as Olas, for short.

## Language

Do:
* Link to [olas.network](https://olas.network) in articles, blog posts or other media mentions describing Olas' own work
* Publicly claim only relationships to the Olas DAO itself that have been recorded in an [on-chain vote](https://boardroom.io/autonolas/overview) or [off-chain vote](https://snapshot.org/#/autonolas.eth), describing these relationships as they are expressed therein. Request DAO contributors' written approval prior to publicly mentioning an existing relationship between you and them, e.g. a partnership, sponsorship, or grant program. 
* Use the specific language used in writing by the DAO in an on/off-chain vote and by DAO contributors regarding the relationship, e.g. 'we have received a grant from Valory, co-creators of Olas' or 'we are sponsoring an event with [name here], an Olas founding member'.
* Those building on Olas must use descriptive phrases that make it clear your product is developed on Olas technology (‚Äúpowered by‚Äù is preferred, but ‚Äúbuilt on‚Äù can also be used). Avoid phrases that imply an official partnership with Olas (‚Äúbuilt with‚Äù, ‚Äúdeveloped with‚Äù, ‚Äúpartnered with‚Äù).
Your company or product name should appear first, followed by Olas and the autonomous service or component name. Using 'Olas' in product or app names is prohibited because it confuses end users, e.g. 'OlasBots', etc.

Do not:
* Use the Olas logo (or part of the Olas logo) alongside or without text in a way that implies the Olas DAO‚Äôs endorsement or sponsorship of a project, service, product or individual.
* Misrepresent, embellish, or invent a relationship between the Olas DAO or any of its contributors and you (for example by implying a partnership where there exists only a grant, or referring to non-finalized agreements). The Olas DAO and its contributors likely have official partnerships and specific language about these partnerships, as well as non-partnership language guidance. If you are not an official partner, please don‚Äôt use ‚Äúcollaborated with,‚Äù ‚Äúworked with,‚Äù or ‚Äúpartnered with,‚Äù in any form. (See above for accurate language.)

## Information about Olas & Press Releases 
When mentioning the Olas DAO or its members or contributors in your press materials, it is kindly asked that you review the following information.

### Key information
#### Introduction
* Context: Olas is Crypto's ocean of services. One single network for all the stuff that makes crypto work. Coordinated by the OLAS token and built on cutting edge, autonomous agent technology.
* Background: Olas consists of the composable [Olas Stack](https://olas.network/build) for developing on Olas and the [Olas Protocol](protocol.olas.network) incentivizing their creation and decentralized operation. Together this architecture works to grow code and capital in tandem via novel mechanisms including [Bonding](https://olas.network/blog/code-capital-attracting-capital-via-bonding), [Developer Rewards](https://olas.network/blog/code-capital-attracting-code-via-developer-rewards), [Triple Lock](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-aip/blob/aip-1/content/aips/core-aip-triple-lock.md), and [Olas Staking using Proof of Active Agent (PoAA)](https://staking.olas.network/). Olas has already given rise to a growing ocean of services, including [Olas Predict](https://olas.network/services/prediction-agents), agents that are predicting the future and leading the charge of Olas agents [taking over Gnosis Chain and beyond](https://dune.com/adrian0x/autonolas-ecosystem-activity). Since 'Olas' means 'waves' in Spanish, it is sometimes referred to as the 'ocean of services' üåä.
* Crypto x AI: Olas is perfect for combining crypto and AI, since autonomous services built using Olas can run complex logic in a decentralized manner, interacting with on- and off-chain data autonomously and continuously. For novel use cases check out [olas.network](https://olas.network/).
